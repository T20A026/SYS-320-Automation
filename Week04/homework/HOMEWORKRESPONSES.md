## Do you see anything of concern with the attempts to obtain a shell?  Provide a brief explanation.
I do see some concers in the shell responses. The second, fourth, and final entires found all have a 200 code, are coming from the same IP, and have a high bite count meaning there is a high chance that the file queies was returned to the attacker. THis is further reinforced by the same location was attempted multiple times. 

## What did you like the most and least about this assignment?
I liked using YAML files again, as I am a fan of them in production, and I also liked the ability to find multiple logs. This means you could scan a whole system drive for a specific type of log, even if it is scattered, and then also scrape through them at the same time. 

## What additional questions do you have?
I have no additional questions
